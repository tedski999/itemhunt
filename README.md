# Item Hunt
### Custom Minecraft Gamemode Server Plugin

This is a simple Bukkit server plugin which adds a fun gamemode to your server.
Players can team up and race to return as many items as they can find or craft before the timer runs out.
The reward for submitting each item can diminish as more teams collect them.
Scores for each team are updated live on the in-game scoreboard.

This plugin allows you to customize the list of collectable items, points rewarded per item collected, PVP scoring and game duration.

## Add To Your Server Now

### Download

`when it's ready`

### Installation

The plugin was made to work with Bukkit-compatible servers, such as [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/).
If you're currently running a vanilla Minecraft server, you will have to first migrate it to a Bukkit-compatible server before being able to add this plugin.
Then you can simply add the plugin `.jar` file to your servers plugin directory, much like any other plugin. The directory is normally just called `plugins`.

After enabling the plugin on the server once, the config file will be generated at `plugins/ItemHunt/config.yml`.
You can edit this file to customize how the gamemode is run.
